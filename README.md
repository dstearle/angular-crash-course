**What Is Angular? :**

- As stated above Angular is a Javascript framework just as React and Vue are. One thing that makes Angular stand out is that it heavily uses Typescript which is a superset of Javascript which can help to catch and prevent errors as you type them out. Angular is similar to Vue in that it is component based, the structure being a folder that typically contains a separate files for HTML, CSS, and Typescript. Unlike React where you need to manually add a lot packages depending on your needs Angular comes fully equipped with a lot of things such as form validation.

**Notes:**

- To run the application use "ng serve"
