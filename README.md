**What Is This Project? :**

- This is a simple todo list built using the Javascript framework called Angular. The user can add/delete items to a list or mark items as listed items as completed.

**What Is Angular? :**

- As stated above Angular is a Javascript framework just as like React and Vue. One thing that makes Angular stand out is that it heavily uses Typescript which is a superset of Javascript. Typescript typically requires you to assign types to values (string, integer, etc) which can help catch and prevent errors as you type them out in your text editor. Angular is similar to Vue in that it is component based, the structure being a folder that typically contains a separate files for HTML, CSS, and Typescript. Unlike React where you need to manually add a lot packages depending on your needs Angular comes fully equipped with many native features such as routing and form validation.

**Notes:**

- To run the application use "ng serve"
